# Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

First you need to go to your GitHub profile (use GitHub.com/yourusername). Once there you will see a plus symbol in the top right corner, which you will click on and it will give you the option to make either a new repository or organization. We want to click on the new repository. It will then take you to a new page that will allow you to make a new repository. You need to make sure that the owner is your profile and then you can name the repository on the right. Next you will go and click the public option so anyone can work on it. Then you'll click add a license and for us we will be using MIT. Once everything has been changed you can go ahead and click on create repository.Then you go to the repository and copy the url link. Finally you type git clone (repository url) and it will be added to your computer.

## Describe what open source means.

Open source allows people to freely edit the source code. Some programs allow people to use them but not edit them. Open source let's people not only use the program but lets them be able to change it however they want.

### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

Open source can definitely have it's pros and cons. It allows for people to do what they wish but can cause the original product to be completely changed. I guess it depends on what I'm making to determine if I would want to make it open source or not. With some projects I could see myself wanting to keep my code in it's original state so that whatever I made can only used the way I intended. Whoever I can also see the benefit of making something and then seeing it grow from other peoples' ideas.

### Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses allow you to be credited with your work but still let people edit it. If you post software without a license then it's fair game for anyone to say it's theirs. When your software is licensed and someone uses it to make their own version, you still have to be mentioned as the original creator. Licensing is a good way to protect your work.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
I'm starting to get better with doing commits and adding them to my Github account but I'm still fairly rough around the edges. I've made myself remember that I always need to change my branch however whenever I'm working on something so I don't use the master.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I just used the resources given to understand the material.
