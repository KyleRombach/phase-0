* How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?

The inspector will you give a list of the elements currently being used by the webpage. It then allows you to edit the margins, padding, borders. You can also change the position the elements will come in using relative, absolute, fixed, and static.

* How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?

You can change the width and height in order to resize the elements.

* What are the differences between absolute, fixed, static, and relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?

Absolute positioning uses the the closest thing to it to determine it's position. If there isn't anything before it, then it will use the body of the document to help orient it's position. Fixed positioning will have the element stay in the same spot if when you scroll on the page. Static positioning is the default positioning that an element will have. A static element will just go with the flow of the page. Relative positioning is moved relative to where it normally was. It will move to where you tell it to go. I'd say relative is the easiest to use because you can just tell it where to go and it will. Absolute can be difficult because you have to make sure you take into account the element before to position it correctly.

* What are the differences between margin, border, and padding?

Margin is the space between an element and another element and/or the sides of a webpage. The border is basically the fence arount an element. Padding is the space around the content but still within the border.

* What was your impression of this challenge overall? (
love, hate, and why?)

This challenge made it much easier to position elements. On the previous pair exercise with the berkshire website I struggled with my partner to organize everything but this made it so much easier to figure out how to properly postion elements.
