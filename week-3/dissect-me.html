  <p>There are many benefits to using a version control system. A VCS allows programmers on a team to work on any file at any given point in time. The VCS will then permit any of these users to merge all of their individual changes into a common version. Apart from the collaborative advantages that it confers, a VCS also allows individual or team-based programmers to restore a previous version of their work, which means that any bugs or errors in the programming of a file can easily be circumvented. Whenever you save or 'commit' a current stage of your project, the VCS also requires you to provide a description of any change that has been made, giving programmers a detailed, comprehensive history of a project's development.</p>
  <p>Okay great, now we have a basic understanding of version control but how do I get it for my computer. Git is a commonly used version control software. When using git you have to do certain commands to get from editing the code to actually changing it. Git will show you what you are working on and if you have anything added that's ready to be committed. Once you've gotten your files added and committed, git will keep a log of what has been done. You can use that log to go back and see what commits you've done and you can also delete any if you don't like the result. You must know that Git only does the changes to your personal computer and you need to add another step if you want to share them online.</p>
<p>So now you've gotten your code ready and you want to share it with others. A website called GitHub allows you to do this. GitHub is basically a software equivalent of Dropbox. For those of you who don't know what Dropbox is, it's a program that allows people to store files online and let people access them. With the use of GitHub, people can upload and download work easily from one another. So in order to use GitHub you'll have to have an account and make a repository for your work to be saved. Once you have a repository you can start pushing your work from git on your computer to the online repository. Here people can send their commits for them to be reviewed and eventually added to the master save.</p>

<!--
What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?

Header, nav, main, footer have been the ones I use most often. Well header is what you usually use to put at the top of the document. I use it to give a title and usually to add my nav bar to the page. Nav is used to order your links in a row. Main is where you have the main content of the webpage. Footer is used to have contact information, copyright information, who wrote the article perhaps, some links that you wouldn't need to have at the top.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?

You should have the header first, which might include the nav.Then next goes main, then aside, then footer. If you have any sections they go after the main as well as well as article. The browser will display the header, then nav if you added one at the top, then main, then section, then article, then footer. Asides will be displayed after sections or articles.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?

I learned how to create a snippet and what snippet is. Yea I'll definitely look into making more snippets in the future cause they'll make thing coding process even more streamlined. I'll also look up to see what one's there is because there could already be one that I need, that I wouldn't have to make.
