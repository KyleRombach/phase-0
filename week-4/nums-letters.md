Puts stands for put string.

# - What is an integer? What is a float?

An interger is a whole number. It will not show decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points.

# - What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Since an integer will not return a decimal it will round down the answer when you divide. So for example, if you divided 12 by 5, you would get back 2 for an integer division. If you were using a float however then you would get 2.4. How is this useful? Well say you have $50 and you want to buy concert tickets that cost $22. So in total it would be $44 for two tickets. You have money leftover however but you can't buy part of a ticket. This is why you would want your site to do integer division so people get the right amount.
