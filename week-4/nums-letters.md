# - What does puts do?

Puts will write onto the screen whatever you have following it. So if you puts 4+5, it would make it write  9.
Puts stands for put string.

# - What is an integer? What is a float?

An interger is a whole number. It will not show decimal points. A float is a number with decimal points.

# - What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

Since an integer will not return a decimal it will round down the answer when you divide. So for example, if you divided 12 by 5, you would get back 2 for an integer division. If you were using a float however then you would get 2.4. How is this useful? Well say you have $50 and you want to buy concert tickets that cost $22. So in total it would be $44 for two tickets. You have money leftover however but you can't buy part of a ticket. This is why you would want your site to do integer division so people get the right amount.

# - mini challenge

```ruby
puts 24*365
```

```ruby
puts 60*24*365
```

# - How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

Ruby allows you to do simple math as if you had a basic calculator.

# - What are strings? Why and when would you use them?

Strings are generally groups of letters and can include punctuation, spaces, symbols, and numbers. Strings are what you use for when you want to write sentences for programs. You can make statements or ask questions if there is no text for the person to read, so that's how strings help.

# - What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

A local variable is when you assign something so when it is used it will puts a string or a number. You use local variables as shortcuts, so you don't have to keep writing certain strings over and over again.

# - How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

I thought this challenge was pretty easy. It was nice going over the basics. I forgot a fair amount of my Ruby skills so I definitely needed a refresher.
