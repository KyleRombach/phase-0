1. - What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

Gathering information is the first phase we need to do. We need to know what our website is for, what we want to do with it, who's it for and how we will provide our information. So some people might make a website for a product they sell, a new social media platform, or just a place to provide information on something. Next do we want to make money or is it just to provide information or perhaps it's both. Then we need to figure out our target audience and how to reach them. You need to figure out if perhaps small articles or videos are the best way to spread your information to the target audience.

Next stage is planning our website. Now that we know what we want to do with our website, we need to make the groundwork. This is were we make a site map so we can have a general layout of what our website will look like.

Now comes the design stage were we figure out how our website should look. This is why you want to figure out your target audience earlier so you can have an idea of how your website should look. You want to make sure it's suited for your audience. It's very important that you use your company's logo and colors to help build your brand.

Phase four is the development of the site. Now that you know what your website is supposed to look like you need to start coding it. You'll most likey make a template that will be used for the various pages of your website.

Once it's been coded you need to test and deliver your website. You need to make sure that everything is working and to make sure it works across the mulitple web browsers people might use. If everything is working, you can then upload your website to your server. You should go one more check to make sure everything works but after that your website is up and running for use!

Just because your website is up and running though doesn't mean you are done. You need to continually provide maintenance to your site. Most people will want to add new to their site fairly regularly, back it up, and update any plugins.


2. - What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?

My site's primary goal is to be a proffessional website to display my work history, some information about myself, my projects, and my blog. This website will help my show off my talents and who I am to potential employers. I'll have my contact information on there, an about me section, my projects, and my blog.

3. - What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?

They want to find good candidates that they can hire for their company. My site will be able to show off my coding ability and give them an idea of who I am as a person.

4. - What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.

For potential employers I want them to be able to see my portfolio, my about me, and my contact information because I feel that is the vital information they need to hire me.
For other developers or people learning I would want them to see my about me as well but also navigate to my blog to see if it can provide them any help.

5. - What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?

You want to know who your target audience is so you can make sure to build your website suited to them. You want to design your website so the usability is best suited for the target audience. If you know people are visiting your site on mobile phones, it would be a good idea to design a mobile version to help with their experience.

6. - What is user experience design and why is it valuable?

User experience design is knowing how someone feels while using your website. Does the proccess make them happy or frustrate them? We want to make the proccess as enjoyable as possible because then people will want to continue using your site. You want to make your site simple to use and have as much accessiblity as possible to reach everyone.

7. - Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

I found it somewhat annoying when using [Write maps](https://www.writemaps.com/) because it didn't allow me to save my site map as an image.Thankfully I was able to find an image creator software on my computer to design my site map manually.
