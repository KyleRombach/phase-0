<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was fairly easy. We had good communication and were able to work off eachother. We learned it helps to lay out the tags first and then fill them in.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

Using codecademy it made learning HTML5 pretty simple. Thankfully we just had to repeat a lot of the same elements so it made it easy.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

Thankfully there wasn't any text that really needed to be formatted. We changed the header size but that was the only formatting we did.


- What seems good and bad about HTML?

While most of the coding is fairly easy to remember sometimes you can have some trouble thinking of the exact element. We've only touched the surface but it seems like you can have some much control over your presentation, which seems really cool.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

Usually the acroynms deal with what you are trying to do. So as long as you can think of condening the words, you can usually figure out most of the elements.
