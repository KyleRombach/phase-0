pseudo code
First determine size of group.
Grouping will either be five or three.
Once grouping determined assign them to groups.
Print out list of all the groups.

- What was the most interesting and most difficult part of this challenge?

It was pretty much up to you to figure out how you want to solve the solution. There was pretty much no guidance other then what you wanted the end result to be but we can make it as in depth or shallow as we want.

- Do you feel you are improving in your ability to write pseudocode and break the problem down?

Yea each time it seems to be easier. It makes me really think about what methods I want to implement based on my ideas of what I want the code to do.

- Was your approach for automating this task a good solution? What could have made it even better?

It allowed me to get the grouping but it could've been better. It needs to have it so the sizing of each group can vary and that the group assignments are random and not based in order. I also need to make the key start at one for the groupings.

- What data structure did you decide to store the accountability groups in and why?

I used a hash because it allowed me to have the accountability groups and then I used an array for the values so the keys could have multiple names for the result.

- What did you learn in the process of refactoring your initial solution? Did you learn any new Ruby methods?

While able to get this to work at the mininum there is still amore more I can learn on how to improve my methods.
