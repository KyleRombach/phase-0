# Person 4

# Identify and describe the Ruby method(s) you implemented
# I used the each method so every element would be tested.
# I used the .include? method to find the strings that contained the letter a.
# I used the .delete method to delete the element based on what I wanted to get rid of.

# Release 1: Identify and describe the Ruby method you implemented. Teach your
# accountability group how to use the methods.
#
#
#


# Release 3: Reflect!
# What did you learn about researching and explaining your research to others?
